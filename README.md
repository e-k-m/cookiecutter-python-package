cookiecutter-python-package is a cookiecutter template of a Python
package. The projects generated with this template have the following

- setup.py and Manifest.in generated accordingly.

- Optionally generated CI/CD stuff.

- Optionally generated CLI entry point.

Please also take note of the following:

  "scripts", "examples" and "docs", for things like helper scripts,
  code examples showing how to use the package and extra
  documentation, respectively.
